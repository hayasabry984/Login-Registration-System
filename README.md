# Login-Registration-System

This app uses Layered Architecture
________________________________________
Feature	--> Support

User API --> Spring Web

Database (Users, Roles, Tokens)	--> Spring Data JPA + PostgreSQL

Authentication & Security --> Spring Security + JWT

Password hashing --> via Spring Security (typically using BCrypt)

Email verification --> Spring Mail

Input validation --> Spring Validation

Secure secrets --> .env with java-dotenv

Rapid development	--> DevTools & Lombok

Testing	--> JUnit & Spring Boot Testing
________________________________________
- A RESTful API is a way for programs (like applications, or Postman) to communicate with backend server using the internet (HTTP)
________________________________________
Action --> HTTP Method--> URL Description

Register new user --> POST -->/api/auth/register --> Client sends user info to register

Login --> POST --> /api/auth/login --> Client sends email & password

Verify email --> GET --> /api/auth/verify --> Click link to verify account
________________________________________
- Authentication: Verifying who you are  Logging in with email + password
- Authorization: Checking what you can access  Can you delete a post? Can you view admin?
________________________________________
🧱 1. Controller Layer

Handles HTTP requests from the client (e.g., register, login).

Receives input, calls the service, sends back the response.
________________________________________
2. Service Layer
   
Contains business logic (e.g., register user, hash password, generate JWT, send email).

Performs the real "thinking" of the app.
________________________________________
3. Repository (Data Access) Layer

Interacts with the database using Spring Data JPA.

Saves, updates, deletes, and queries user data.
________________________________________
4. Model/Entity Layer

Defines the structure of your data (e.g., User class maps to the users table in the DB).

Represents your app’s data or database structure.
________________________________________
🔑 Summary:

Client → Controller → Service → Repository → Database
________________________________________
Flow :

Frontend or Postman -----> Your Spring Boot App (Server) (Embedded Tomcat Server) -----> Database (PostgreSQL)                       
________________________________________


The main entities (or actors):
1. Client: Enters email, password, etc., to register or log in.
________________________________________
2. Frontend simulation using postman: Sends HTTP requests (like register/login) to your backend.
________________________________________
3. Backend (Spring Boot app) Your Java application.
   
   . The backend is everything that runs on the server (all the backend layers, business logic, DB access, etc.).

   . Receives requests from the frontend.  (Controller Layer)

   . Handles business logic (registration, login, email verification). (Service Layer)

   . Validates input, encrypts passwords, creates JWT tokens. (Service Layer)

   . Talks to the database. (Repository Layer)

   . Sends responses back. (Controller Layer)
________________________________________
4. Server (Tomcat inside Spring Boot) The "engine" running your backend.

   . The server is part of the backend.

   . When you run your app Spring Boot Starts an embedded server by default it's called Tomcat

   . Listens for requests on http://localhost:8080 (this is your server's address during development ) using Embedded Tomcat server (automatically set up by Spring Boot)

   . Routes requests to your Java code (controllers). Using Controller Layer (@RestController)

   . Sends responses to the client. Using Spring Boot + your Controller's return values (like ResponseEntity)
________________________________________
5. Database (A PostgreSQL server you set up (e.g., authdb))

   . Stores user accounts (email, password hash, etc.).

   . Can store verification tokens, roles, etc.

   . Backend reads/writes data here using Spring Data JPA.
________________________________________
6. Database Client (pgAdmin or CLI):

   Tool for you, the developer to Let you manually view or manage database tables and data.
________________________________________
Client: Uses the system

Frontend: Sends user data to backend (Postman/UI)

Backend: Processes data, logic, talks to DB

Server (Tomcat): Runs the backend and serves API endpoints

Database: Stores persistent user data

DB Client: Lets you inspect/manage the DB


________________________________________

JWT (JSON Web Token)
A JWT is a compact, secure way to transmit user data (like user ID or roles) between client and server after login. It has 3 parts:

Header – contains token type and signing algorithm

Payload – contains user data (claims)

Signature – ensures the token is not tampered with

JWTs are serialized and sent to the client as JSON after login/registration.

The JWT filter on the server handles incoming requests that contain that token — to verify it and authenticate the user.

🔐 This ensures secure access to protected endpoints.
________________________________________

JWT_SECRET_KEY
The JWT_SECRET_KEY is used by the server to:

Sign the token when creating it

Verify the token when receiving it

If the token’s signature doesn’t match (e.g., someone changed the payload), it’s rejected.

________________________________________

How it works 

User logs in

Server verifies credentials and creates a JWT signed with JWT_SECRET_KEY

JWT is sent to the client

Client sends JWT with each request (usually in the Authorization header)

Server uses JWT_SECRET_KEY to verify and extract user info from the token

Full Flow from Client to Database and Back 
Client Sends Request
   (e.g., user submits login or registration form)

▶ Controller Layer
Receives HTTP request (e.g., /register, /login)
Parses it into a DTO like RegisterRequest or LoginRequest
Calls Service Layer, passing the DTO

▶ DTO Package
Used by the controller to collect and pass user input
Keeps internal models (entities) safe from exposure

▶ Service Layer
Takes the DTO, applies business logic:
Validates input
Hashes password using a bean from config
Creates a User entity from the DTO
Calls Repository to save user
Generates JWT
Prepares a Response object to return
Returns a response DTO like AuthenticationResponse

▶ Repository Layer
Saves the User (Entity) to the database
May also fetch user by email/username for login

▶ Model/Entity Layer
User class defines the table structure
Used internally by Service and Repository

▶ Responses Package
Contains the final objects (e.g., AuthenticationResponse, MessageResponse) returned to the Controller
These are serialized into JSON and sent back to the client

▶ Config Package
Provides:
Password encoder bean
JWT token filter
Security configuration for route access
CORS settings, etc.
Used across the Service Layer and security system

Back to Client
Controller returns the Response DTO to the frontend
Client gets result (e.g., login success, token, error message)
